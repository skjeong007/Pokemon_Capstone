__Pokemon Battle Predictor using ML__  
Originally created for BrainStation's Demo Day Capstone Project.  

  The following is a project that was completed to showcase what I have learned over the course of 12 weeks at BrainStation's Data Science Diploma program. With the use of Machine Learning and other Python concepts, I built this project with the hope of constantly improving this code until I am confident in my own personal skills or I am happy with potentially moving forward (either monetizing into a product, or moving on to another project). 
  
  The Jupyter notebook contains code involving a Battle Predictor for the popular role-playing game Pokemon. The game revolves primarily around battling these creatures against other AI and players in order to knock out the opposing team's Pokemon. While fully coding all functionalities of competitive Pokemon is quite complex, this project aims to target new or casual players in assisting them to transition into competitive Pokemon battling.
